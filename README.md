# CheckLists App V2, based on a the book iOS Apprentice 6th Edition

STARTING AT CHAPTER 17

I created this App by following along with the book, but somehow there's something wrong with the code
at the end of Chapter 16 that I simply can't find.  I'm fairly sure the bug has nothing to do with the
code itself, because I did my best to compare it to the original book.

I think my weakness is more of an issue with the Interface Builder itself.  Somewhere along the line
I either missed a drag and drop of some control, or dragged the wrong item to the wrong place.

For what it's worth, I hate when an IDE requires you to do anything using a graphic interace that
can't be done by writing code by hand.  When you have code, at least you can see where you make a mistake.

I created a this NEW repository by using the code provided by the publisher, so it's fully operational up to the start
of chapter 17.  Hopefully, I'll be able to finish it without needed to re-start.

Lastly... I HIGHLY recommend this book.  If you want to learn iOS development using Swift, YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK!
